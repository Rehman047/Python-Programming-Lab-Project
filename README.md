1.	Project Objectives
The main objective of this project is to develop an interactive, user-friendly dashboard that allows users to upload their bank statement CSV files and gain insights into their financial habits. The system will:
-	Automatically categorize transactions (e.g., Food, Travel, Bills)
-	Display summaries and visualizations (monthly expenses, category-wise spending)
-	Perform basic trend analysis and detect anomalies (e.g., unusually large transactions)
-	Provide basic ML-powered suggestions (e.g., predicted expenses for next month)
2.	Methodology
Data Analysis:
-	Input: CSV files exported from banking apps (e.g., date, description, amount, type)
-	Data Cleaning: Remove nulls, standardize date formats, correct inconsistencies- Processing: Categorization, monthly summaries, outlier detection
GUI (Streamlit):
-	Upload CSV, filter data, and view interactive charts (line, pie, bar)
User Interactivity:
-	Users can filter by date/category, add custom labels, and download reports
Machine Learning Basics:
-	Predict expenses using simple regression
-	Flag suspicious transactions using basic anomaly detection
3.	Expected Outcomes
-	A dashboard where users upload and analyze bank statements
-	Visual breakdown of financial activity
-	ML insights for budgeting and anomaly detection
-	Optional export of graphs and comparison features
4.	Visual Insight Example
A bar or pie chart will display spending across categories such as Food, Transport, Shopping, Utilities, etc. Users will be able to quickly identify their major spending areas and adjust their budget accordingly.
